## SEO Overview

Search Engine Optimization Tips.
* SEO looks for information in H1 tags and then works down to
H6 tags. The more important the information, the more likely
it should go into an H1 tag.
* You should only have one H1 tag per page. More than that
and your SEO may go down.
* Do not add ghost pages or hidden text to improve your SEO
score. It has been tried and your SEO score will go down.

4. Add structured data markup - Google Search works hard to understand the content of a page. You can help us by providing explicit clues about the meaning of a page to Google by including structured data on the page.
