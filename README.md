# HTML5300 Course Project

The goal of this course project is to

* Build a responsive site with a modern design of your choosing.

* Use Vue as a front-end framework.
* Build visualizations of public data from a third-party API.
* Use professional project management strategy.

## Topic

I want to build myself a personal website that could be used as my online resume.

The website should have a home page that briefly lists my experiences and skills, a contact page where users can submit their contact information, and an About page that tells my story and skills in detail. The pages can also be covered in one single page using clean presentation and concise language.   

### API

Gallery that uses flexbox to show pictures with 3 or 4 columns in grid.
Google map shows my current location.
User form input that submits contact information.
